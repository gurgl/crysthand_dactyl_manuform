# Crystalhand's Dactyl
This is my version of the Dactyl with a number of modifications and additions.  I changed a number of constants to variables to make it easier to modify.



Customization for dactyl
- Ergodox like layout for a wider range of supported keys
- Curve/slope front back and left/right for alphas and thumb controlled separately
- Thumb cluster layout
- Thumb offset and orientation angle
- Number of rows (5-dactyl or 4-lightcycle)
- Profile selection (ie high low or custom)
- Optional detachable wrist rests with customizable height and slope



Notes
All screws used are m3x12 for the dactyl.  
Brass knurled nuts m3x5x5 are used for to attatch the dactyl top and bottom case and the Manuform top and bottom cover.
m3x12 screws and nuts are used to attatch the wrist rests to the case

TRRS jack being used is SJ-43514.
